# CompressionÂ -of-Graph-Neural-Networks
we empirically examine the effects of pruning and quantization methods on some different GNN models applied to three graph datasets involving Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. We compared the inference time, model size, and accuracy of the quantized and pruned GNNs versus baseline GNNs.
